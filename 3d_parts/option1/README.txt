# Summary

Didn't like the original mount so I designed this :)
Allows for adjustable angle!

*Please note that this is designed for 20mm standoffs instead of the original 15mm to allow for the tilting (also I used a 4in1 stack and had no 15mm standoffs handy :)
You can adjust the height in the openscad file tho!*

I attached the openscad file for your tinkering pleasure (easily adjustable for other cameras i.e.).

Warning! I didn't clean it up very well and I ended up hacking in one or 2 things (marked hack).
Also the distance adjustment is not super accurate and I ended up making the screw mounts for the cam piece 0.3mm wider on each side (cam_mount_x=2.5; where it was cam_mount_x=2.2; for the standoffs).

Also some of the variable names are meh in hindsight but whatever - use it or leave it, I might optimize this to make it a good customizer item in the future :)

Tolerance is very tight on the cam opening!

* you will need 2xM2 screws :)

Lastly, I would like to mention that I took inspiration from this thing but designed it from scratch: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2530332

# Print Settings

Printer: Malyan M150
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 100%

Notes: 
I printed it in PC-ABS which is rigid.
I printed it at 102% which comes out perfect for me.
Lay on the flat side and print without supports!
